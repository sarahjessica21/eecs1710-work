# So, for my final project I wanted to create one of those light up sound boards that people create music with. There are 32 different audio samples to play with. I made every audio sample button white so when the mouse presses on them they each light up a different colour and it really stands out. I also added play and pause buttons which play a song that can play in the background as you use the audio samples over it. This is a creative opportunity to spice up the song. You can also change the speed and frequency of the song by rolling the mouse over the two audio waves at the bottom. Any time you want to stop there is a pause button that stops the song where its at and plays it back where you paused it. It's supposed to be fun for the viewer to play with the samples on their own or see what beats he/she can come up with that'll match the theme of the song.
