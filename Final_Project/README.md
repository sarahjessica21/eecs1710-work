# So, for my final project I wanted to create one of those production pads that people create music with. There are 32 different audio samples to play with plus a song that you can use as background music to play the samples over to create your own beat. I also wanted a voice option where you can sing/rap in real time and also change the frequency of your voice in real time. It's definitely supposed to be more fun/funny sounding than sounding like actual music. Since each audio sample is white or grey in colour they each have a specfic colour they turn when pressed. Below them is a green play button and orange stop button that plays and stops the song. Beside those two buttons is the vocal option with the frequncy adjustment.
