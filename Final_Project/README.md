# So, for my final project I wanted to create one of those light up sound boards that people create music with. There are 32 different audio samples to play with plus a song that you can use as background music to play the samples over to create your own beat. I also added a song in which you can change the speed and frequency to. You can use the buttons over this or you can just play the song by itself. It's definitely supposed to be more fun/funny sounding than sounding like actual music. Since each audio sample button is white or grey in colour they each have a specfic colour they turn when pressed. Kind of like they're lighting up. Below them is a green play button and orange stop button that plays and stops the song. Beside those two buttons are fake buttons for the aesthetic to make it look more like a real sound board. Underneath all that is the songs frequncy and speed adjustment.
